~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* REMOVED FEATURES *
remove single player games from list - filter by genre - unfortunately not entirely possible - user defined tags are much more accurate and they are not provided in API - tried web scraping - works except for if there is an age check for the game - therefore will not implement until api will give access to this information.

Name ideas: The Saac (sack of games to pick)
